# Help Module Examples

This directory contains examples of how to use the `help` module.

## Important Note

These examples are for illustrative purposes only. The `help` module is a Wails service, which means it is designed to run within a Wails application. The Go files in this directory are not runnable on their own as they depend on the Wails runtime and other services that are not present in a standard Go command-line application.

To use the `help` module, you should integrate it into your Wails project. The examples demonstrate the basic API calls for the `Show()` and `ShowAt()` functions.
